This V2 version of TARS is very different from the first version.
You cannot mix and match the parts from the original version as the sizes are different.

The 3d printed parts are designed to use heat inserts. Another version without heat inserts is in the works.
It is highly recommended that you use the same battery used because of it size and weight.
The design can support a hailo module but this is not required.
The design suggest using a battery sensor, it is also not required.
It is suggested to use the WM9060 audio hat module as it has the microphones integreted along with providing stereo sound.

It is possible to use the V2 servo motion control but you will need to reset the servo positions using the presets and following the instructions in the assembly guide.

The space in the case is very restricted and there will not be much room if you choose to use other modules.

The screw length is not specified in many places, use your judgement, normally it's mostly 10mm long. At the time I did this documentation, I had already assembled the robot.
